Test generator intended to generate multiple test variants from single test source. Works with closed tests (where one of possible answers should be chosen). Written in Perl, works with TeX.

You write the test question in one big LaTeX file, and it will extract latex variants from it which can be rendered to pdf.

An example (requires perl and latex) is located here:

This generator is pretty simple. It has been used in several courses in Sofia University. We'll be happy to help any attempts to use it or contribute to it.
